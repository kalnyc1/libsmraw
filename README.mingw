Creating a DLL using MinGW

To compile a libsmraw DLL using mingw you'll need:
* mingw with:
  * Windows Crypto API (libadvapi32)
* mingw build of zlib library and headers

If no mingw build of zlib is availble, you'll need to build it from the sources.
For this you can use a script similar to the following:

#!/bin/sh
CC=/opt/local/bin/i386-mingw32-gcc
CXX=/opt/local/bin/i386-mingw32-g++
AR=/opt/local/bin/i386-mingw32-ar
OBJDUMP=/opt/local/bin/i386-mingw32-objdump
RANLIB=/opt/local/bin/i386-mingw32-ranlib
STRIP=/opt/local/bin/i386-mingw32-strip
MINGWFLAGS="-mwin32 -mconsole -march=i586 "
CFLAGS="$MINGWFLAGS"
CXXFLAGS="$MINGWFLAGS"

./configure --prefix=/opt/local/i386-mingw32
CC=$CC CXX=$CXX AR=$AR OBJDUMP=$OBJDUMP RANLIB=$RANLIB STRIP=$STRIP CFLAGS="$CFLAGS" CXXFLAGS="$CXXFLAGS" make

And install it in the mingw build tree with:
sudo make install

To build a DLL using mingw use:
mingw32-configure --enable-winapi=yes
mingw32-make

It is recommended that you use WINAPI support but it is possible to compile 
libsmraw without it (--enable-winapi=no). Without WINAPI support libsmraw will
need a mingw build of openssl libcrypto for MD5 support

If mingw32-configure and mingw32-make are not available you'll need to build
it by hand. For this you can use a script similar to the following:

#!/bin/sh
CC=/opt/local/bin/i386-mingw32-gcc
CXX=/opt/local/bin/i386-mingw32-g++
AR=/opt/local/bin/i386-mingw32-ar
OBJDUMP=/opt/local/bin/i386-mingw32-objdump
RANLIB=/opt/local/bin/i386-mingw32-ranlib
STRIP=/opt/local/bin/i386-mingw32-strip
MINGWFLAGS="-mwin32 -mconsole -march=i586 "
CFLAGS="$MINGWFLAGS"
CXXFLAGS="$MINGWFLAGS"

CC=$CC CXX=$CXX AR=$AR OBJDUMP=$OBJDUMP RANLIB=$RANLIB STRIP=$STRIP ./configure --target=i586-mingw32msvc --host=i586 --enable-winapi=yes
CC=$CC CXX=$CXX AR=$AR OBJDUMP=$OBJDUMP RANLIB=$RANLIB STRIP=$STRIP CFLAGS="$CFLAGS" CXXFLAGS="$CXXFLAGS" make

You should end up with the following DLL:
libsmraw-<version>/libsmraw/.libs/libsmraw-1.dll
